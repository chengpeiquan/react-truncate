This package provides a series of React components for text ellipsis scenarios such as truncating multi-line text or ellipsis in the middle.

<StatisticalData />

## Introduction

This is a Fork version from [react-truncate](https://github.com/pablosichert/react-truncate) (Based on `v2.4.0` ) .

The following upgrades have been made based on this version:

1. Use React Hooks instead of Class syntax to extend support for React 18+
2. Use TypeScript to refactor the source code and provide more complete type declarations (no need to install additional `@types/react-truncate` package)
3. Built-in `<ShowMore />` component (the original author’s [another package](https://github.com/pablosichert/react-show-more), which encapsulates `<Truncate />`, exists and Similar problems with Truncate are no longer maintained)
4. Built-in new `<MiddleTruncate />` component to realize ellipsis in the middle of text (encapsulation of `<Truncate />`)

Since the original version has not been maintained for a long time and the original author [@pablosichert](https://github.com/pablosichert) is no longer active, it is planned to handle some issues that need to be solved through this repository. Thanks to the original author Years of dedication.
