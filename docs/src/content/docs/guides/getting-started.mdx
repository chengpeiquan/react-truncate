This package provides a series of React components for text omission scenarios such as truncating multi-line text or ellipsis in the middle.

<StatisticalData />

## Introduction

This is a Fork version from [react-truncate](https://github.com/pablosichert/react-truncate) (Based on `v2.4.0` ) .

The following upgrades have been made based on this version:

1. Use React Hooks instead of Class syntax to extend support for React 18+
2. Use TypeScript to refactor the source code and provide more complete type declarations (no need to install additional `@types/react-truncate` package)
3. Built-in `<ShowMore />` component (the original author’s [another package](https://github.com/pablosichert/react-show-more), which encapsulates `<Truncate />`, exists and Similar problems with Truncate are no longer maintained)
4. Built-in new `<MiddleTruncate />` component to realize ellipsis in the middle of text (encapsulation of `<Truncate />`)

Since the original version has not been maintained for a long time and the original author is rarely active, it is planned to handle some issues that need to be solved through this repository. Thanks to the original author Years of dedication.
